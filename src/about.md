Hello, and welcome to my blog!

At Solid Quant, I want to dive into projects that I never had the chance to in the past.

I've been making excuses not to start a blog, because I was busy tolling away at work. But I decided no more.

I left work to do some soul searching, and to study just about anything that interests me.

Hope this blog can be of good read to you ðŸ˜Ž
