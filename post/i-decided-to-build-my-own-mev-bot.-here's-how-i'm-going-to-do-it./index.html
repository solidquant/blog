            I only recently found out about the realm of MEVs despite having
            traded in the crypto space for some time already. My work mainly
            revolved around trading in spots and futures markets in CeFi, so I
            never really bothered to look into DeFi that much.
          </p>
          <p>
            But one of my clients wanted to build an automated trading bot using
            Uniswap V3. And I thought:
            <em>‚ÄòOh, what the heck. How hard can it be?‚Äô</em>, and just took on
            the project.
          </p>
          <p>Oh boy, was I in for a bumpy ride üßóüèº.</p>
          <p>
            Though I briefly knew what an AMM was, I never really grasped the
            math behind it. So I scanned through documentations and public
            resources I could find on Google. It took me like a week to really
            get a picture of what DEXs were trying to do. And it took another
            couple of days to build a JS bot that monitored Uniswap V3 pool
            prices and sent swapping transactions upon predefined events.
          </p>
          <p>
            After the project was over, I was intrigued by DeFi and wanted to
            further pursue this path, but then was met with this giant called
            <strong>MEV</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead of just giving up, I decided to tackle the problem head on
            and face the giant. I would learn everything about MEV bots and just
            create one for myself. Then I‚Äôll be able to overcome the fear, and
            maybe even successfully find my own alpha.
          </p>
          <p>
            But the most important reason for this venture is to understand the
            cutting edge technologies behind blockchain ecosystems. I hated how
            I feared leaving my safety zone and considering blockchains and
            DeFi‚Äôs as black boxes. I knew if I put the time in, I would be able
            to understand the concepts with confidence.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong
              >So I am documenting the whole process here to give other starting
              fellows an idea of how much input you are going to need to put
              into building MEV bots.</strong
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            Below, I am sharing the complete road map to learning MEV bot
            building. Since I am just a beginner in this space, I decided to
            build a bot from the ground up and gauge the time it would take
            someone to build such a program with no prior knowledge of this
            domain whatsoever. But I wanted to do it the right and the robust
            way.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em
              ><strong>A little background sharing of myself:</strong> I used to
              build high frequency trading strategies in CeFi for the past 2
              years, and I used to be an AI engineer before that for another
              couple of years. So I‚Äôm not entirely new to programming per se. I
              used Python, Javascript, and C# extensively in multiple projects,
              but always had the temptation to adopt Rust within my newer ones.
              So I‚Äôve decided to study Rust this time.</em

          <h4 id="my-roadmap" tabindex="-1">My Roadmap</h4>
          <p>
            I embarked on this journey just 3 days ago (June 7th, 2023).
            <em>(So yes, my resolution might not stick too long)</em> The first
            3 days involved planning ahead by understanding what I am trying to
            accomplish here.
          </p>
          <p>
            The MEV space was quite secretive so I couldn‚Äôt find a good
            reference for a starting point. But digging around kind of paid off
            and I noticed that there were pretty huge communities either trying
            to fix the MEV issue, or profit from it. They were both extremely
            helpful to begin the journey.
          </p>
          <p>A couple of reference points:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.flashbots.net/">Flashbots</a></li>
            <li>
              <a
                href="https://calblockchain.mirror.xyz/c56CHOu-Wow_50qPp2Wlg0rhUvdz1HLbGSUWlB_KX9o"
                >The 0 to 1 Guide for MEV</a
              >
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            I also noticed that there were many scams out there related to MEVs.
            So I had to filter out my sources with extra care.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <p>¬†</p>
          <p>I intend to study all of the following:</p>
          <p>
            <strong>1. Rust</strong><br />
            <strong>2. Solidity/Yul</strong><br />
            <strong>3. Uniswap</strong><br />
            <strong>4. Flashloans</strong><br />
            <strong>5. Gas optimization</strong><br />
            <strong>6. Flashbots</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            I‚Äôve also seen on Twitter that studying Geth is probably the best
            way to get started with MEV. Though for me, that‚Äôs a pretty big
            hurdle. So I‚Äôll see what I can achieve with the minimum amount of
            knowledge necessary and build up from there if I feel like more is
            needed.
          </p>

          <p>
            With this knowledge, I plan on building the 3 types of MEV bots that
            people are most familiar with:
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>1. Bot #1: Frontrunning bot</strong><br />
            <strong>2. Bot #2: Sandwiching bot</strong><br />
            <strong>3. Bot #3: Uniswap JIT provisioning bot</strong>
          </p>
          <p>and share the results to this community.</p>
          <p>
            I‚Äôll try and see how difficult the task is for a layman to get
            started with, also documenting the sources that I‚Äôve referred to as
            I move on forward. And by doing this, I feel like I can make my
            resolution stick this time, and help others trying to get involved
            with MEVs by giving them an idea of how difficult the task is, and
            how long it will take for them to get started.
          </p>
          <p>Anyone else with me on this journey? Good luck everyone!</p>
